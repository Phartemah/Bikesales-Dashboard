Bike Sale Dashboard
~ Got information (customer ID, Age, Commute distance, Region, Marital status, Gender, Income, Education, Occupation) of customers who made enquiry about bike but either decided to buy the bike or not buy the bike

~ Cleaned the data, prepared it, created pivot tables.

~ Built a compelling  insight-driven narrative and designed concise data visualisations to communicate my results effectively and reduce complexity.

RESULTS
~  Based on the analysis performed to determine wether they buy the bike or not, customers who lives 0-1miles away from their office purchased the bikes more
~ Customers within the middle age group purchased the bike more
~ Customers who earned more purchased the bike more
